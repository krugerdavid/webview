Q/ I get this error message when I try to migrate processes

	"This system does not seems to be configured to allow process
	 migration from here. Please refer to the documentation for
	 instructions on how to enable process migration from
	 openSSI webView"

A/ Your system is not configured to allow process migration. If you want
   to enable this feature, you should install sudo
   <http://www.courtesan.com/sudo> and add the following line to your
   /etc/sudoers file:

	<USER> ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/migrate

   Replace <USER> with the valid user specified in the previous step, and
   be careful to exactly respect this syntax, as openSSI webView scripts 
   rely on it.
   After this, you should be able to migrate processes from the
   openSSI webView process page.

Q/ What are 'system processes', and why can't I migrate them?

A/ openSSI webView considers all processes whose uid is strictly smaller 
   than 1000 (uid < 1000) as system processes. Modern unices often start 
   creating users with uid greater than 1000, and keep smaller uids for 
   non-interactive users. The ability to migrate system processes from a 
   web interface could certainly be considered as a security issue, 
   that's why it's disabled by default. However, this behaviour can be 
   configured or disabled in the openSSI webView configuration file 
   (config.php)
